## Notes

We talked about the contribution [Move "Why this is important" to before requirements](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/811) after having had it mature for a while and we continue to think it will make the requirements easier to understand.
Thus we marked it ready for review.

While related, we noted that the issue [Review "What does this not do" sections](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/813) should be dealt with after merging this contribution and should not be considered a blocker.
