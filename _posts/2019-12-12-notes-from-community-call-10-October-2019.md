# Notes from community call - 10 October 2019

For transparency, we're sharing the update we prepared for this community call even though no one attended the call.

## Update from the Foundation

* We're gearing up for our Open Day next week, focusing on codebase stewardship in practice. We'll have workshops exploring how to collaborate on codebase governance and design a codebase to be easy and inviting for potential reusers. International guests working with public sector open source collaborations will share their experiences. Some of us are currently full-on with logistics and workshop design.
* We have a new minor release of [Standard for Public Code, 0.1.3](https://github.com/standard-for-public-code/standard-for-public-code/releases/tag/0.1.3).
* Our development of stewardship progresses and we're [adding some new assets](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/pull/430) to our website later today.
* We have started working with a professional visualizer to create diagrams explaining stewardship and governance.
