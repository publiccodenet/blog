## Notes

National public organizations might have access to professional translators in the EU languages which opens up a totally different path than traditional community translations by volunteers.
The Foundation for Public Code could then take institutional responsibility for overseeing and merging translations in collaboration with a community for each language.
This solution seemed particularly interesting and the Foundation for Public Code will look into this path next.

As a short term solution the Standard for Public Code could also be modularized further.
Of particular interest would be an executive summary that also would be quicker to translate and at the same time might be the most important part to localize.

Foundation for Public code staff gave a summary of the [previous community call about translations](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2020/08/24/notes-from-community-call-6-august-2020.html) and how we've been thinking about translations.
Jan described how it would be a lot easier for people just doing translations if platforms designed for this are used (with features like translation memory or documentation about what's being translated) and how those can be automated to commit to a git repository.

Boris described another system with forks with version numbers.
This can be enabled by having one leading version which lets the Standard for Public Code to evolve at its own pace.
Each fork could then choose any system they wanted for translation to suit their language community.

But both of these directions will be on hold while the possibility of professional translators is being explored.
