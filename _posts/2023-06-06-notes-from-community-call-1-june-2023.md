## Notes

In this call we had a general discussion about public code and the use of the Standard for Public code.
For instance, we talked about the general need of case management systems in public organizations, and how they are emerging in many different places.

We also touched upon the complexity of procurement and a bit about open source in the federal governement in the USA, comparing it to the state in Europe.

While talking about hackathons or other focused efforts, we reflected on the efforts that were done with the Dutch Covid tracing app, where trust was gained by developing in the open and in collaboration with passionate civic tech advocates.

Finally, we were thinking about how municipalities or other public organizations who are developing open source software could collaborate with universities, especially in the case for students needing larger final assignements.
