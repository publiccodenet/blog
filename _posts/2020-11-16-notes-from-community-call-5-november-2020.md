## Notes

During the call, we discussed why implementing the Standard for Public Code can sometimes be challenging. We covered several different aspects relating to governance (i.e., who decides to comply with the Standard?), language (i.e., are the decision makers comfortable with adopting a standard only described in English?) and committment (i.e., what does it mean for the organisation to commit to comply with the Standard?).

No direct solutions were discovered during the call, but being aware of them could lead to the questions being addressed earlier and more appropriately.

Special thanks to Charlotte Heikendorf for taking the time to write about our new Standard for Public Code release [in English](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/new-release-standard-public-code) and in the [Danish OS2 codebase website](https://os2.eu/blog/ny-release-af-standard-public-code).
