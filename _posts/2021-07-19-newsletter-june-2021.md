# OSPO Alliance and annual report: June 2021 newsletter

In June, we broadened our horizons 🌍, with participation in a number of international events and an exciting new initiative.

## Highlights

- the [OSPO Alliance launched](https://newsroom.eclipse.org/news/announcements/leading-european-open-source-non-profit-organizations-announce-ospo-alliance)! We're proud to be a founding member of this new coalition to help organizations discover and understand open source.

- we published [our first annual report](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/annual-reports/) - read about our achievements so far and plans for the year ahead

## Upcoming events

We have no confirmed external events coming up - instead, we're looking forward to summer breaks and recharging.

- The July Foundation for Public Code community call will take place on Thurs, 15 July at 15.00 CEST. We're still deciding the topic - let us know if there's anything you'd like to talk about!
- We'll be hosting 2 half-day reviews of our  oldest documentation on 22 July and 26 August. You're welcome to join us - check our Twitter account the week before for more joining details.
