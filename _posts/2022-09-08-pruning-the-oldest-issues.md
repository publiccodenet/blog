## Notes

We started by reviewing [the notes from the last session]({% post_url 2022-07-14-pruning-the-oldest-issues %}):

* [define your product design principles #315](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/315) - transferred to the implementation guide repository
* [Providing a definition what transparent, accountable, understandable means in the context of public software #317](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/317) - closed with comment
* [Provide a definition of the core values in the context of public code #318](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/318) - closed with comment
* [Make the "Code in the open" MUST (unless used) more general applicable #324](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/324) - closed with comment

Then we continued with:

* [Possible further reading on commit messages #337](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/337) - transferred to the implementation guide repository
* [Security issues medium #339](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/339) - fixed by [#415](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/415)
* [Link to auditing template #350](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/350) - we think this could be solved in synergy with [Automate review template updates #1201](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/issues/1201), work session planned on September 12
* [Add further reading for Ethics considerations #357](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/357) - transferred to the implementation guide repository
* [Add how the Standard supports the SDGs to the intro #358](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/358) - commented about usability in the publiccode.net repository, made a [pull request](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/695) for partial solution, stays open

Last, we reviewed the [roadmap](https://standard.publiccode.net/docs/roadmap.html) and [proposed a small update](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/696) that adjusts it to be inline with the [latest release](https://github.com/standard-for-public-code/standard-for-public-code/releases/tag/0.4.0) and the [implementation guide](https://standard-for-public-code.github.io/community-implementation-guide-standard/).
