## Questions

Terminal warns this is missing its Github authentication - does it connect back to Github at all?

```
"GitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data."
```

I'm missing a _layouts directory. Where should that go?

Removing frontmatter removes need for a post layout; applies sitewide default.


## Missing

- [X] about this blog
- [X] Populate contact page (with HTML and our info) - solved by deleting
- [X] something that makes at least the most recent post text appear on the index
- [ ] layout file for posts
- [ ] Go back to https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/front-matter-defaults/ to set up default post layout after reading about layouts
- [ ] front matter rendering for posts
- [ ] internal nav: eg breadcrumbs to get from post back to index
- [ ] internal nav: link to both the blog's about and http site
- [ ] favicon (warns GitHub)
- [ ] RSS feed?
- [ ] social sharing
