Hello,

Welcome to our newsletter, bumper summer edition. Like last summer, many of the people we work with went on holiday, but that hasn't slowed us down.

🏅 Perfectly timed to get us pumped for summer, we got an Encouragement Award from the Netherlands Internet Society (as part of their annual Innovation Award) in June. [Read more on our blog](https://blog.publiccode.net/news/2020/06/17/isoc-encouragement-award-consider-us-encouraged.html).

## What we've been up to 👩‍💻 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏽 🤙

### Codebase stewardship

* We currently have 2 codebases under stewardship: [Signalen](https://publiccode.net/codebases/signalen.html) and [OpenZaak](https://publiccode.net/codebases/openzaak.html). Both codebases are focused on growing their open source communities in 2020.
* In June, we built a prototype product marketing website for OpenZaak: [openzaak.org](https://openzaak.org/).
* In July, [Felix](https://publiccode.net/team/felix-faassen.html) blogged about his experiences with the OpenZaak market consultation. [Read his blogpost](https://blog.publiccode.net/codebase%20stewardship/2020/07/01/openzaak-market-consultation-workshops.html).
* Also in July, [Alba](https://twitter.com/Alba_Roza) developed a communications plan for Signalen, finished a 🎥 [video introducing Signalen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2Z-mRFt3pg), and launched the Signalen communications steering group.
* Throughout July and August, [Eric](https://publiccode.net/team/eric-herman.html) and [Jan](https://publiccode.net/team/jan-ainali.html) worked with the Signalen and OpenZaak codebase communities to bring the codebases closer to Standard compliance (for example [adding a licence header to each source code file in OpenZaak](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/pull/672)).
* In August, we hosted the Signalen Community Day Online with the VNG (Dutch Association of Municipalities), attended by current Signalen users and contributors plus cities interested in using it in the future 🏙️🏙️. The workshop had 2 focuses:  strengthening Signalen's product management and integrating Signalen into existing IT infrastructure. The output was the creation of product steering group and a prioritized feature backlog.

### Members

* We're currently in active membership negotiations with 🌍 2 cities, 1 province and 1 national government (in 2 countries).
* Despite the holidays, we had initial conversations with 2 cities and 1 national government (in 3 more countries).
* People have started to reach out to us again after their holidays, and we are ready 💪💪.

### Running the Foundation

* We took advantage of the summer lull to focus on our own maintenance and administration.
* We reorganized how the Board of Directors gets updates from the Foundation. [Ben](https://publiccode.net/team/ben-cerveny.html), [Boris](https://publiccode.net/team/boris-van-hoytema.html), [Laura](https://publiccode.net/team/laura-scheske.html) and [Claus](https://publiccode.net/team/claus-mullie.html) are now working on a logframe and roadmap so there's more clarity and predictabilty about our goals and how we'll get there. We'll publish these when they're ready.
* In operations, [Deborah](https://publiccode.net/team/deborah-meibergen.html) has updated our financial forecasting model, upgraded our chat server, launched new tools to support our community (Mailman, Podbean and StreamYard), and has been experimenting with putting Jitsi on a more stable and scalable footing.
* For communications, [Floris](http://flrs.nl/contact) is producing beautiful new illustrations and we've reorganised the [illustrations repo](https://github.com/publiccodenet/illustrations) so each illustration has better metadata. [Elena](https://publiccode.net/team/elena-findley-de-regt.html) and Ryan are working on a refresh of [publiccode.net](https://publiccode.net/).

## Community and public recognition (spreading the word!) 🗣️💃🙌

* We've been included in the Swedish [open data knowledge sharing wiki](https://gitlab.com/open-data-knowledge-sharing/wiki/-/wikis/Standard-for-Public-Code) and the EU's Open Source Observatory's [resource catalog](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/specific-resources#section-32).
* Our August [Standard for Public Code community call](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2020/08/24/notes-from-community-call-6-august-2020.html) on internationalization had the most participants we've had yet at a community call - 11 participants from 5 countries! We host [monthly community calls](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/community-calls/) for both the Standard and the Foundation for Public Code.
* Laura presented on codebase stewardship at [Barcamp: Verwaltung. Digital. Gestalten](https://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/de/dps/barcamp_200820), hosted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems and NextNetz.
* 👩‍🎤👨‍🎤 We're launching our podcast [Let's talk public code](https://twitter.com/publiccodenet/status/1300406171334062080) on September 8 - we're very excited for our first guest, and think you'll be too.
* Boris is giving a talk at State of the Source on why open source is different in government on 10 September - [you can still sign up](https://opensource.org/StateOfTheSource)
