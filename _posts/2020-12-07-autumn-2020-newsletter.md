# Foundation for Public Code newsletter - autumn 2020

![illustration of hand with speech bubbles containing screws and bolts]({{site.url}}/assets/service-3.png)

Welcome to our autumn newsletter, covering September - November 2020. We've had a focused, productive autumn, continuing our work with codebase communities and potential members.

In the months ahead, we hope to announce new members and incubate a new codebase.

You can [read our last newsletter]({% post_url 2020-12-02-summer-2020-newsletter %}) (summer 2020) on our blog.

## What we've been up to

### Codebase stewardship

The stewards team spent this autumn on community, tooling and governance support for the 2 codebases we're stewarding: Signalen and OpenZaak.

#### Signalen

We helped the Signalen community to collaborate better by setting up a mailing list for them in September. They're now using it to get a shared backlog online, so they're ready to start quarterly roadmaps in 2021.

The [Signalen product website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120093134/https://signalen.org/en/) is now also available in English.

In November, the Signalen community updated the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/) gap analysis included in their codebase community. [See the new version.](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals/blob/master/docs/topics/signalen-and-standard-for-public-code.md)

#### OpenZaak

Throughout the autumn, the OpenZaak [mailing list](https://lists.publiccode.net/mailman/postorius/lists/openzaak-discuss.lists.publiccode.net/) has been [humming](https://lists.publiccode.net/hyperkitty/hyperkitty/list/openzaak-discuss@lists.publiccode.net/) - it's been a joy to see the community develop new norms and practices around working together.

#### New work

In October we released a [new version (0.2.0)](https://github.com/standard-for-public-code/standard-for-public-code/releases/tag/0.2.0) of the Standard for Public Code.

Stewards held workshops with two development teams on how to apply the Standard in their codebase development and specifically in their environment.

The codebase stewards are also exploring new opportunities:

- meeting with 3 new codebase communities
- developing an online [training course on how to use the Standard for Public Code](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/issues/792) for [distribution by OASC](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331054335/https://citybycity.academy/)

### Members

![illustration of hand holding a heart]({{site.url}}/assets/trustworthy.png)

We have a new member! The Province of South Holland (the Netherlands) decided to join the Foundation for Public Code in June, and is now ironing out legal details.

We also held discussions throughout the autumn with 3 national governments and 2 cities. We hope to have a public announcement in the new year.

### Running the Foundation

We've received two new philanthropic gifts, which means we have more breathing space as we expand our offering.

During the global week for the Sustainable Development Goals (September 2020) we made an addition to our [value and impact page](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/sustainable-development-goals.html) and [blogged about how we support the goals]({% post_url 2020-10-02-we-support-the-sustainable-development-goals %}).

We're happy to be able to stay at our curent premises on the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam until spring 2021.

Our Operations Coordinator, [Deborah], is working on bringing our operations handbook online. It's a handy blueprint for anyone who needs to set up and manage key systems to run an open organization like ours. Explore  [our tool management page](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/tool-management/) to see the tools we use.

Deborah has also steadily improved our technology systems, ranging from spinning up a Jitsi instance for our community, troubleshooting an [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) issue that impacted our mailing lists, as well as spinning up a VPS for colleagues and community members to co-work via [Virtual Network Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing). We've also migrated Odoo, our project management and CRM tool, to a new provider.

## Community outreach

We're very proud to have launched our podcast, [Let's talk about public code](https://podcast.publiccode.net/). So far, we've spoken with:

- Arnau Monterde from Decidim ([live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFAb8QaDXFY), [podcast](https://podcast.publiccode.net/e/lets-talk-about-public-code-1-arnau-monterde-decidim/))
- Rasmus Frey from OS2 ([live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAkT9h4owhs), [podcast](https://podcast.publiccode.net/e/lets-talk-about-public-code-2-rasmus-frey-os2/))

In September, [Boris](https://publiccode.net/team/boris-van-hoytema.html) presented at the State of the Source Summit 2020: [How Open Source in Public Administrations and Government is different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7B2809l6EU).

During Global Goals Week, [Ben](https://publiccode.net/team/ben-cerveny.html) spoke on a panel about [Opensourcing our way to the SDGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkeQzL5q5t4&list=PL_5ziu2gADmDcp_ER8x2rcT1HOBaIe5cl&index=4).

In October, Ben spoke on a panel about "Visions for the Future Internet: what if?" at the [Next Generation Internet Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0avTD7WR1U).

We also ran 2 sessions at the Creative Commons Global Summit and made a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt6vB-cipE) explaining the Standard for Public Code as a common good.

In November, [Alba](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225190155/https://publiccode.net/who-we-are/team/alba-roza.html) gave a presentation at [EsLibre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBi551I2E2c) (in Spanish) and was on a panel at DecidimFest on [Sustainability and scalability in free software projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4rXEjJlm8Q&feature=youtu.be).

[Felix](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225192009/https://publiccode.net/who-we-are/team/felix-faassen.html) wrote [an article about how government and market parties are jointly building the OpenZaak community](https://opensource.pleio.nl/groups/view/57979222/open-source/blog/view/57979368/gemeenten-en-de-markt-bouwen-samen-de-openzaak-community) for the Dutch national open source forum ([opensource.pleio.nl](https://opensource.pleio.nl/)).

Last week, [Jan](https://publiccode.net/team/jan-ainali.html) ran a workshop on how to effectively do "Open Source in the Public Sector" at the [Swedish GovTechDay](https://web.archive.org/web/20200611122646/https://www.govtechday.se/om-govtech-day) ([slides](https://hackmd.io/@Ainali/H1EQUI99D#/) in Swedish).
