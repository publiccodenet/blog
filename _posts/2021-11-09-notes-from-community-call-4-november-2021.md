## Glossary

### Background

In the Standard for Public Code, we talk about contexts without really defining it.
We would like to get more input before we [create a glossary term](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/529).

### Notes

We agreed that even though there was some notion of what it might mean, the term was ambiguous enugh to deserve a clarification.
After some discussion, this is our proposal for the glossary:

**Different contexts** - two contexts are different if they are different public organizations or different departments for which there is not one decision maker that could make collaboration happen naturally.

## Non-english

### Background of non-english

In our [community call in September](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2021/09/08/notes-from-community-call-2-september-2021.html), we talked about non-English terms.
We have had a discussion in the ongoing pull requests and would like to make a final check before merging them.

* [Issue #223: Add nuance on where non-English is acceptable](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/527)
* [Issue #308: Clarify intersection of policy-defined vocabulary and Use Plain English](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/528)

### Notes of non-english

We agreed that it would be good to better define what `plain English` means in the Standard for Public Code.
We agreed to:

* make a a glossary definition inline with our requirement today (lower secondary education reading level, as recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2)
* make sure that all places that needs it, uses this term
* move [the suggested link](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/about/definitions/) to Further reading as it adds value, but isn't specific as a definition

After discussing the new requirement about policy being executed we agreed that using the term `business domain` would open it too wide.
We also recognized the need for using non-English terms, but that all the relevant use cases that we could see, would in effect be covered by our suggestions.
