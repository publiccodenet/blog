## Notes

In this call we gave a thorough introduction to the Foundation of Public Code and how we work. Then we moved on to the [long backlog of open issues](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc) in the Standard for Public Code repository and worked through them from oldest to newest. This is the result of our pruning, which is also reflected in the GitHub repository:
