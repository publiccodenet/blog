## Notes

### Background

Continuing on [our last community call]({% post_url 2022-01-11-notes-from-community-call-6-january-2022 %}) we want to dig further into how existing policies, laws, regulations and strategies, applicable to and made by a public organization, make demands on codebases developed by them.

This discussion has a long history and several related issues:

* [[Bundle policy and source code] Account to business processes #568](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/568)
* [Require documenting policy in the codebase (as part of 'bundle policy and code') #378](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/378)
* ['Bundle policy and source code' can be interpreted very wide #224](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/224)
* [Bundle policy and code: invite policy makers to contribute their own work in their own formats #62](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/62)

### Discussion

In this call we started by taking a good look at the suggestions made in [issue #568](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/568) which we felt provided a good start for an update of the criterion.
After some discussion, this valuable input helped us towards the idea that we could make two substantial improvments.

First, we felt the need of expanding on the section "Why this is important", especially since this criterion is what really makes the Standard for Public Code unique.

Then we also recognized the need for an expansion under "Policy makers: what you need to do" in order to make it clear that policy, according to our [glossary](https://standard.publiccode.net/glossary.html), has a wider meaning than in the general language.

We ended the call by creating a [draft pull request](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/573) with changes to partially address both these realizations.
