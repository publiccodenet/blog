# We've joined the Digital Public Goods Alliance

The Foundation for Public Code is proud to have joined the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) (DPGA) as a new member. The DPGA is a multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods.

We're thrilled to be participating in this mission. And we believe our work to enable open and collaborative public-purpose software for public organizations can play a critical role in helping to achieve the DPGA's mission and advance the DPG ecosystem overall.

The Foundation for Public Code's work aligns with that of the DPGA in the following ways, which are included as part of the DPGA's Annual Roadmap:

* we steward the Standard for Public Code, which is also a Digital Public Good. Early standard compliance helps important projects scale and achieve results sooner.
* we're ready to provide codebase stewardship for DPG codebases. Expert codebase stewardship strengthens codebase communities, increasing sustainability and trust.

"Promoting digital public goods to create a more equitable world." - Tagline of the DPGA

Being a member of the DPGA allows us to act on our commitment to the SDGs. Together with peer organizations who share our values, our expertise will have the most global impact on the DPGA.

As a non-partisan organization responsible for a technical standard, we don't set any ethical requirements. But we also believe strongly that public purpose codebases must have clear ethics to succeed.

All codebases we've supported towards meeting the Standard for Public Code should also qualify as Digital Public Goods. We believe this is not a coincidence.

Joining our work with other DPGA members will hopefully speed up SDG attainment worldwide.

We're honored that we can provide a technical standard that ensures that DPGs are more replicable and sustainable.
