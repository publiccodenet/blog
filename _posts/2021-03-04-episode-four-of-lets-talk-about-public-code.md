# Episode four of Let's talk about public code!

In the fourth episode we talked to Lea Hemetsberger from [Open & Agile Smart Cities](https://oascities.org/) (OASC).
We discussed how OASC collaborates with cities worldwide to support their digital transformation journey.
We also talked about one of their latest resources, the [CITYxCITY Academy](https://citibycity.academy).
