### Add vendor and platform independence as a criterion #47

We started the discussion from the following [suggestion](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/47#issuecomment-831146535):

> Required services and platforms SHOULD be available from multiple vendors.

After a quite long discussion, this was deemed to be a good phrasing.

In addition, the discussion also lead to a suggestion for a new requirement:

> The development of the code base SHOULD be a collaboration between multiple parties.

We liked this idea about highlightng how important collaboration is for increasing the independence in each organization as it goes beyond the current requirement stating a codebase SHOULD be reused by multiple parties.
It also connects to a newly created issue: [Review the use of 'reuse' #543](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/543).

While talking, we also identified a need of expanding the value of this under the sections "Why this is important" in several criteria.

### Community translations

We briefly informed about the new [community translations for the Standard for public Code](https://github.com/standard-for-public-code/community-translations-standard).
