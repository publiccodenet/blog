*Internet Society Netherlands commissioned this awesome cartoon of us by [Eva Hilhorst](https://evahilhorst.blogspot.com/).*

The Dutch chapter of the Internet Society (ISOC) has recognised the work of the Foundation for Public Code with the 2020 *Aanmoedegingsprijs* (Encouragement Award). We were proud to be nominated for the annual Innovation Award, and are delighted by Internet Society Netherlands' encouragement.

Foundation for Public Code CEO Boris van Hoytema says:

> I'm happy that the hard work we're doing making collaboration on public purpose software commonplace is recognised.

The [Internet Society Netherlands press release](https://awards.isoc.nl/innovatie/2020/) (in Dutch) says:

> The Foundation for Public Code won the Encouragement Award 2020. The jury sees great potential in the initiative and looks forward to a structural contribution to a healthy open source culture within the public sector.

We're heartened to share this encouragement with the broader Foundation for Public Code community - the team is excited and eager to continue our work.
